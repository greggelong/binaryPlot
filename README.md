# binaryPlot
A binary plot visualizer made in p5.js to plot number sequences, inspired by some plots plots in Wolfram's Mathworld.

It can be adjusted to plot 8 and 16 bit numbers (and others as well)
I am plotting in binary the natural numbers from 0 to 255. These are 8 bit numbers the leftmost slice is zero and right most is 255. I start counting from the bottom up.

I have plotted the first 255 squares and triangular numbers too.  

I was also inspired by a talk by Douglas Hofstadter on intertwined patterns of integers and patterns of thought.
